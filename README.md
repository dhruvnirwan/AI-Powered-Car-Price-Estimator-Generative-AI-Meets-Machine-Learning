# 🚗 AI-Driven Car Price Prediction using Generative AI & Machine Learning  

## 📌 Overview  
This project predicts **used car prices** by training **Machine Learning (ML)** models on historical car data and applying **Generative AI (GenAI)** for natural-language insights.  
The dataset **`ford.csv`** contains features like model, year, transmission, mileage, fuel type, tax, mpg, and engine size.

## 🔄 Workflow  

### 1. Data Preprocessing  
- Handle missing values  
- Encode categorical features (fuel type, transmission, model)  
- Normalize/scale numerical features  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Study distribution of price, mileage, and car age  
- Detect outliers and correlations  
- Visualize relationships between features  

### 3. Model Training (Final Stage)  

#### 🧠 Machine Learning  
- Trained ML regression models: **Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost**  
- Target variable: **Price**  
- Evaluation metrics: **RMSE, MAE, R²**  

#### 🤖 Generative AI  
- Generates **human-friendly explanations** of model results  
- Provides **summary reports** of feature importance  
- Example output:  
  > "Cars with lower mileage and newer year tend to have higher predicted prices. Transmission type also has a significant effect on valuation."

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Machine Learning**: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost  
- **Generative AI**: LLMs for insights & explanations  

---

## 📊 Results  
- ML models provide accurate predictions of car prices.  
- GenAI adds value by explaining **why** prices are predicted in an understandable way.  

---

## 🚀 Future Scope  
- Add deployment with **Streamlit/Flask** for interactive predictions  
- Extend dataset with multiple car brands and geographies  
- Use advanced GenAI for **Q&A-style recommendations** (e.g., "Best car under ₹10 lakhs with <50,000 mileage")
